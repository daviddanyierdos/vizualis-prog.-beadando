This is a WPF application suitable for storing, among other things, people (and their data), functioning as a kind of phonebook.

At the Login table (for "signing in"), the data to be entered are as follows: Username: User1 Password: 123

- after clicking Submit, the 'PhoneBook' window will load with its functions (File, Query, New/Modify). You can manage cities, phone numbers, and individuals within the application (i.e., perform queries within the Query menu). The following data is associated with individuals: name, address, postal code, city, and phone number. You can modify any existing data by category (cities, phone numbers, individuals), and you can also add new data (a new city, new phone number, new person) using the New/Modify menu. By selecting the Exit option in the File menu, you can close the application.
